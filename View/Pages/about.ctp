<p>Everything else here is technical, so I'll start out with something different. I'm a recently new father of a perfectly healthy boy. Connor Martin Trapp is his name, and he mostly just eats, sleeps, poops and cries. He's not very good at anything other than that yet.</p>

<p>I'm a web developer at <a href="http://loadsys.com" target="_blank">Loadsys</a>. We make web applications using CakePHP. <a href="http://cakephp.org">CakePHP</a> was my first introduction into development with a framework. Prior to that, I hacked together some rather embarrassing plain HTML/PHP sites. I started out at Loadsys as an intern for 8 months before finishing college and have worked there full time since graduation. All the guys at Loadsys are awesome, and they've helped me become a much better programmer than I could have on my own!</p>

<p>While PHP and CakePHP were my first, I am also interested in some other languages. I've recently leaned <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>, and am now working with the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> framework and <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra DSL</a>.</p>

<p>Can't escape working with Javascript in web application development, and in that arena, I prefer <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>. As our apps are getting bigger, I'm also looking into client side frameworks like <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>. Also, <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> is awesome, and my preferred way of writing any Javascript.</p>

<p>Enough of that. Checkout the <?php echo $this->Html->link('posts', array('controller' => 'posts')); ?> I've written for something that might interest you.
